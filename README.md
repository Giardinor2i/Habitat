Habitat for FXM

This fork of Habitat provides a demonstration of several techniques that extend Sitecore's FXM capability.
The techniques demonstrated are as follows:

* FXM Item Renderer - A rendering that can be used in a FXM placeholder to render an item with a layout and nested placeholders
* Prepend CSS Selector Transform - A transform that can be used with the FXM bundling mechanism to prepend a selector to all style rules in the bundle.  
* FXM Beacon Events - An example of how to use FXM beacon events as a hook for JavaScript initialization that would normally be accomplished from the document ready event.
* Link Rendering - Link rendering in the itemExtension class is enhanced to provide the correct Url options to the LinkManager when in the context of FXM
