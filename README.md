Habitat for FXM

This fork of Habitat provides a demonstration of several techniques that extend Sitecore's FXM capability.
The techniques demonstrated are as follows:

* FXM Item Renderer - A rendering that can be used in a FXM placeholder to render a item with a layout and nested placeholders
* Prepend CSS Selector Transform - A bundle transform that can be used with the FXM bundling mechanism to prepend a selector to all style rules in the bundle.  
* FXM Beacon Events - An example of how to use FXM beacon events as a hook for JavaScript initialization.
* Link Rendering - Link rendering in the ItemExtension class is modified to provide the correct Url options when in the context of FXM
